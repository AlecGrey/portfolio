# Welcome to my Portfolio Repo!

(It is a work in progress..)

TODO

* [ ] create js file for each section of the site (welcome, about, etc.)
* [ ] move animations and all functionality into js files
* [ ] create factory functions to build objects containing functionality for each page.  Objects should:
    * [ ] Mount/unmount page information to the DOM
    * [ ] add event listeners upon mounting
    * [ ] hold each animation timeline, with ability to play and reverse as needed
